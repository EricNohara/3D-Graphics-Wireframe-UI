# 3D-Graphics-Wireframe-UI

## Description:

Written in Python using numpy and matplot. UI for 3D linear transformations on wireframes generated by converting the wireframe vectors to matricies and performing matrix operations on them.

## Functionality:

* Switch between 3 default wireframes
* Transformations:
  * Roll
  * Pitch
  * Yaw
